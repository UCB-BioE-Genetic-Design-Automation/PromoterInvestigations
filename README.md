# PromoterInvestigations
For a given input of a human gene name (only genes with NCBI gene IDs supported), determines where consensus transcription binding sites (for TFs expressed/present in the humans; determined from ChIP-seq motifs) are present in the promoter (1000bp upstream of transcriptional start site). Identifies CRISPR-Cas9 editing strategy (sgRNAs and repair constructs) for deleting the TF sites individually and outputs a cloning strategy to be carried out and primers to order for an in vivo investigation of the promoter.

To begin, run the InvestigatePromoter class.
